# Search Operator Generator

## Overview
The Search Operator Generator is a simple, user-friendly web application designed to help users create search query strings with specific operators (`inurl`, `intitle`, `intext`, `inanchor`) for advanced search functionalities. This tool automatically formats your input keyword(s) into a string that can be copied and pasted into search engines to perform more targeted searches.

## Features
- **Keyword Input**: Users can input keywords or phrases they wish to include in their search criteria.
- **Automatic Generation**: With a click of a button or a press of the Enter key, the application generates a search string combining the keyword with advanced search operators.
- **Clipboard Copy**: Users can easily copy the generated string to their clipboard with one click, streamlining the search process.

## How to Use

2. **Enter Keyword(s)**: Type the keyword or phrase you want to use in the search operators in the input field.
3. **Generate String**: Click the "Generate" button or press the Enter key to generate the search string.
4. **Copy to Clipboard**: Click the "Copy to Clipboard" button to copy the generated string. You can now paste it into the search bar of your preferred search engine.
